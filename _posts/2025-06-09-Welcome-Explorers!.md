Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Kitty, and I live in the gorgeous Pacific Northwest, where it seems like every day I find something new and wonderful in this unique and beautiful place I call home. I love it so much that I genuinely want to share it with others who just might love it, too. I make experiential content - together we'll be adventure cats 🐈‍⬛, exploring the PNW, one paw print at a time!🐾 If you enjoy nature 🌲, animals 🐱🐶🦌🐋, hiking 🥾, history 📚, art 🖼️, local culture 🏙️, food 🍽️, geocaching 🧭, travel ideas 🌎, hot spots 🍿, hidden gems 💎, and just having fun 🤩, then this content is for you! I hope you enjoy exploring with me, and that you find inspiration to live your own life of adventure! In the meantime, let's see what we can discover together! 😸 #PNWPawAdventures 🐾
